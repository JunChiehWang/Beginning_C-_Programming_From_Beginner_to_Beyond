* lldb to debug

* Compile with g++ :
g++ -Wall -std=c++14 main.cpp -o main.exe

* web-based c++ compiler :
http://cpp.sh/
https://www.onlinegdb.com/
https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/

* Compiler Explorer â€” an online tool for viewing compiler output
(ref: https://itnext.io/the-case-for-c-4122a5b47130)
https://godbolt.org/

* undefined reference to '...'
it means linker error, cannot find the file, wrong path, ....

* std::cout << "....."
<< is string insertion operator, insert whatever on the right hand side of it
into that stream on the left.
>> is string extraction operator, take something from the consol on the left
and store it in the variable on the right

* cout and << doesn't automatically add line breaks
  cout << "aa" << data << endl;
  cout << "aa" << data << "\n";
endl(end line operator) will also flush the stream. if the stream is buffered it may not get
written to the console until it's flushed.

* preprocessor doesn't understand c++

* comments:
preprocessor strip out the comments so the compiler never sees it.
(1) single-line comment: //
(2) multi-line comment: /*
                               */
(3) don't comment obvious
(4) use the style of the comments consistent
(5) don't use comment to do version control, use a real version control
    system

* namespace:
(1) explicitly using namespace
(2) using namespace directive
(3) qualified using namespace


* global variable:
(1) initialized to 0
(2) local variable with the same name shadows the global variable
(3) can potentially cause problems


* use single quotes instead of double quotes to initialize a character data
type "char" (which hold a single character). double quotes would make it a
string.
